                My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. 
                My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, 
                where all the villas are, and I am not married. 
                I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, 
                and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, 
                but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get 
                eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm 
                milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, 
                I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, 
                I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told 
                there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that 
                I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to 
                trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would 
                cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and 
                I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight 
                I wouldn't lose to anyone.
